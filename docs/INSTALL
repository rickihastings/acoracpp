ACORA IRC SERVICES


How To Install Nevitus
----------------------

In the root directory, type the following:

./configure
make
make install

* You might have to use gmake instead of make on some systems.

Once done, make sure you edit your conf/acora.conf file.
To start the services, type './acora start' in the root directory.


How To Install Modules
----------------------

To install a third party module, copy the module to src/modules.
Copy the module's language files to languages/<module_name>.
For example, if the module is named m_foobar, create a directory
called languages/m_foobar by typing this in the root directory:

mkdir languages/m_foobar

Then copy the language files in the directory just created.

To compile, you could just follow the same steps as for compiling
the services themselves, but if you'd like to compile and install
ONLY the modules, do the following.

In the root directory, type:

make modules
make modinstall

* You have to run ./configure first if you haven't yet already.
* You might have to use gmake instead of make on some systems.
